======

Welcome to my website!

I am an applied economist mainly interested in the fields of **Labor, Regional, Development, and International Economics**. Currently, I am a **Postdoctoral Research Fellow** at the [Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI)](https://www.esri.ie/) in the area of Trade, Competitiveness, and Foreign Direct Investment.

My **Job Market paper** studies the local effects of trade liberalization on college wage premia, housing costs, and urban amenities in Mexico between 1990 and 2010.

I joined ESRI after completing my PhD in Economics at [Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/Economics/). I received my Master's in Economics from the [Universidad Nacional de Colombia (UNAL)](https://fce.unal.edu.co/facultad/).
