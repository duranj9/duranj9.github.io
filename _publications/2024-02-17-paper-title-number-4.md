This paper empirically investigates the impact of inward foreign direct investment, with a focus on multinational firms holding dominant market shares (i.e. superstar firms), on wage dispersion between firms across European regions. The analysis uses firm-level data from the ORBIS Europe data set over 2012-2021 combined with a range of economic and social data at the regional level. Using a shift-share instrumental variables approach, we find that foreign direct investment, particularly international superstar firms, contributed to increased wage inequality between firms across European regions.
